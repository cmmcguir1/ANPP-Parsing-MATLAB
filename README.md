# ANPP-Parsing-MATLAB
Tools for parsing Advanced Navigation Packet Protocol logs in MATLAB.

No data logs are included in this repository. You will need to provide your own logs.

The main anpp_parsing.m script is incomplete and only includes grabbing packets that I needed for a task. You'll likely need to add some code to grab packets of whichever ID you're after.
